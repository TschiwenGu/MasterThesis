> This is the Master Thesis of Qiwen Gu, a student of INFOTECH, University of Stuttgart, Germany.

> A web-based tool for assisting the developers to guide their architectural refactoring process based on specific scenarios.

> Terms: micro-services, monolithic migration, architectural refactoring, web demo


## Getting Started

The following instructions will enable you to build a local environment for development and running purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

In order to use and rest the web-based tool, the following prerequisites should be fulfilled, and detailed set up processes are illustrated in "Installing" section.


- Windows Operation System
- A web browser
- PHP scripting language for web development
- MySQL Database
- Apache HTTP Server


### Installing

In this section, a step by step series of process will show you how to set up a development and running environment to use the web-based tool.

**STEP1**
> Download <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html/" target="_blank">**XAMPP**</a> for Windows, a free and easy to install Apache distribution containing PHP and MySQL.

After the installer is downloaded from official website, you can run the installer as an administrator. 

In some cases, alert windows may pop up to inform you that an antivirus software is running, or an activated User Account Control (UAC) may restrict some functions of XAMPP. It is fine to ignore these alerts and continue the installation process.

In next step, you can select the components to install. In this case, Apache, MySQL, PHP and phpMyAdmin are included as mindesten components in order to build a complete running environment.
